## Description

 The Main goal is to map a webpage which could help user to get the weather information by searching each city.
 Used the JavaScript to function everything step. The critical step is fetch which could help get the informaion from api.
 and the most challenge will be the each element. Still have a lot to do to make it better and easier to code. May have to look deeply into the for loop function and also the json localstorage. Gave each searched city button function to grab the value. Also there is another way which is to save the information to localstorage, and will fetch again when user click on the searched city history button.
 And for this page I gave each card each element one by one. Actually I can also use for-loop to append the card and class the first child to make it col-12(the biggest one) to achive the same layout.
